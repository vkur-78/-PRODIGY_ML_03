# Cats vs Dogs Image Classification with SVM

## Introduction

Welcome to the Cats vs Dogs Image Classification project using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The primary objective is to employ machine learning techniques to accurately classify images as either cats or dogs. This project includes a basic overview of the dataset, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of an SVM classifier.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Thoroughly exploring the dataset provides insights into its characteristics. This involves analyzing data distributions, handling outliers, addressing missing values, and visualizing key trends. EDA plays a pivotal role in guiding subsequent modeling decisions and ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

## Model Comparison

Three machine learning models are implemented: Linear Support Vector Machine, Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel SVM, and Polynomial Kernel SVM. Each model is chosen based on its suitability for the task and potential to capture underlying patterns in the data. Training and evaluation of each model enable the comparison of their performance metrics to determine the most effective SVM kernel for cat vs dog image classification.

## Results

After a detailed comparison, the Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel SVM emerges as the most accurate model for classifying cats and dogs. The performance metrics, including accuracy and classification report, showcase its superior capability in capturing dataset patterns. This SVM kernel is selected as the final choice for image classification in this project.

## Future Steps

As this project represents an initial exploration into SVM-based image classification, there is room for improvement. Future steps involve experimenting with additional feature engineering techniques, exploring advanced models, and further optimizing the selected SVM kernel to enhance predictive accuracy.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project serves as a practical introduction to image classification using SVMs. Through EDA and model comparison, valuable insights are gained into the dataset, leading to the identification of a robust SVM kernel for distinguishing between cats and dogs. This experience lays the groundwork for future projects and continuous learning in the field of machine learning.
